      This is NOT THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE for Leavitt Township, Oceana County, Michigan.
    </p>

    <p>
      The township board when asked repeatedly by myself would not publish meeting minutes, ordinances
      and other documents on their public website, <a href="http://leavitttownship.org">http://leavitttownship.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stated reason per Emma Kirwin, the township supervisor, for not posting the meeting notes and the laws this council is creating for this community is "liability advice from their lawyer", yet documents were being posted on the website previously and were removed. Access is currently provided by emailing Naomi Oomen, the township clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I am publishing all minutes and related documents on this website as I get them in my spare time. Minutes have been provided by Naomi via USB drive and email as requested (preemptively even as of May), and ordinances provided by Emma via email as requested. This includes the ordinance regarding cannabis grow facilities.
