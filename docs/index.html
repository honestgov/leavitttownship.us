      This is NOT THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE for Leavitt Township, Oceana County, Michigan.
    </p>

    <p>
      The township board when asked repeatedly by myself would not publish meeting minutes, ordinances
      and other documents on their public website, <a href="http://leavitttownship.org">http://leavitttownship.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stated reason per Emma Kirwin, the township supervisor, for not posting the meeting notes and the laws this council is creating for this community is "liability advice from their lawyer", yet documents were being posted on the website previously and were removed. Access is currently provided by emailing Naomi Oomen, the township clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I am publishing all minutes and related documents on this website as I get them in my spare time. Minutes have been provided by Naomi via USB drive and email as requested (preemptively even as of May), and ordinances provided by Emma via email as requested. This includes the ordinance regarding cannabis grow facilities.

    <p>A <a href="https://www.shelbytownshipoceana.com/millage-information-for-new-sheriffs-jail-in-oceana-county"> link </a> to millage information from the Sheriff on a new country jail.</p>

    <p>Despite the importance of treating unconvicted prisoners fairly (remember you can end up in jail tomorrow for the most minor of things), the previous
    document does not answer any important questions about how the existing jail is being used.
    Please see <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/jailexpansion.html">https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/jailexpansion.html</a> for more information and decide for yourself if a
    new facility is in the overall best interests of the county.</p>
