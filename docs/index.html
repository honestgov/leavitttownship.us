      This is NOT THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE for Leavitt Township, Oceana County, Michigan.
    </p>

    <p>
      The township board when asked repeatedly by myself would not publish meeting minutes, ordinances
      and other documents on their public website, <a>http://leavitttownship.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stated reason per Emma Kirwin for not posting the laws they are creating for this community is "liability advice from their lawyer", yet documents were being posted on the website previously and were
      intentionally taken down. Instead of arguing I am publishing all minutes and related documents on this website as I get them, to the best of my ability.
